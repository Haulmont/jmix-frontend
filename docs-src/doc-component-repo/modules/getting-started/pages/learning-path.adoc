If you want to create a React-based Frontend UI, check our xref:client-react:starter-guide.adoc[React Client] guide.

If you want to migrate from Cuba Frontend UI to Jmix Frontend UI, check our xref:migration-cuba-to-jmix.adoc[Migration cuba to jmix] guide.

If you want to use a different framework, check xref:typescript-sdk:index.adoc[TypeScript SDK] and {api_rest}[Jmix REST] documentation.

If you want to build a frontend client that works well on both desktop and mobile but not sure which framework to use, we suggest building a xref:client-react:starter-guide.adoc[React Client] as this is currently the most well-supported option.

If you are stuck, or your specific use case is not covered by this documentation - feel free to contact us at {forum}[our forum].
